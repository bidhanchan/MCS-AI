What is AI? 
Artificial intelligence (AI) would be the possession of intelligence, or the exercise of thought, by machines such as computers. The goal of artificial intelligence is to make the machines think and hopefully make them as capable of thinking as human beings. 

AI Perspectives: Thinking and acting humanely and rationally
	Humanly	Rationally
Thinking 	Systems should solve problems the same way humans do.	Need to worry about modelling uncertainty and dealing with complexity.
Acting	The Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing (1950), was designed as a thought experiment that would sidestep the 
philosophical vagueness of the question “Can a machine think?”	the study of rational agents: agents that maximize the expected value of their performance measure given what they currently know
History of AI
1956 - John McCarthy coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’ and had the first AI conference.
1969 - Shakey was the first general-purpose mobile robot built. It is now able to do things with a purpose vs. just a list of instructions.
1997 - Supercomputer ‘Deep Blue’ was designed, and it defeated the world champion chess player in a match. It was a massive milestone by IBM to create this large computer.
2002 - The first commercially successful robotic vacuum cleaner was created. 
2005 - 2019 - Today, we have speech recognition, robotic process automation (RPA), a dancing robot, smart homes, and other innovations make their debut.
2020 - Baidu releases the LinearFold AI algorithm to medical and scientific and medical teams developing a vaccine during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The algorithm can predict the RNA sequence of the virus in only 27 seconds, which is 120 times faster than other methods. 
Influences
 	     Philosophy considers the nature of knowledge, thought, and learning
Mathematics considers the notions of formal logic, algorithms, computational complexity, and probability
Economics studies how agents attempt to maximize their own well-being, even when given uncertain information and in the presence of allies and adversaries
Neuroscience studies the workings of the human brain
Psychology studies how humans and animals think and act (process information)
Linguistics deals with language in a formal-enough way that it can be processed by machine
Computer Engineering looks to increase the efficiency of computing devices
Control Theory and Cybernetics consider how autonomous machines can operate
